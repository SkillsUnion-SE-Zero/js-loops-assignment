# JavaScript Loops: Assignment

## Problems

### 1: Multiplication Tables

1. Write a `for` loop that will iterate from `0` until `10`.
1. For each iteration of the `for` loop, it will multiply the number by `9` and log the result (e.g. `"2 * 9 = 18"`).

**Bonus:**

- Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total)

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 2: The Grade Assigner

Check the results for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc.

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 3: Favorite TV Shows

1. Create an Array to hold your favorite TV shows
1. For each show, print to the console a string like:

   ```
   My #1 choice is Person of Interest
   My #2 choice is Battlestar Galactica
   ```

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 4: Age Filter

1. Create an Array to hold a list of ages
1. Loop through and log only the ages that are over 21

```js
// Your Answer
```

## Optional Bonus Problems

### 1: The even/odd reporter

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 2: Change Odd Numbers

Change all **odd numbers** in the Array to their value multiplied by 2:

```js
const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

// Your Answer

console.log(numbers); // => [4, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]
```
